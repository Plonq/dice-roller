## Dice Roller

A simple dice roller made with Babylon, for funsies. I roughly copied the style of the dice roller that D&D Beyond has.

I had more plans for this, but gave up because I got sick of Babylon. The physics had issues, and Babylon's
documentation sucks when it comes to anything custom (at least relating to physics).
